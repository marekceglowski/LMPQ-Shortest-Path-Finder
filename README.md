# LudiMazePQ-Shortest-Path-Finder
Find's shortest path from start to end passing through required rooms for LMPQ.

### Rules:
The goal for the members completing this challenge is to divide the rooms amongst eachother to complete it the fastest and meet up in the final room (16). 

Each room has three portals that take a player into another room. You start in room 1. 
* The left portal increases room number by 4. 
* The middle portal increases room number by 7. 
* The right portal decreases room number by 3. 

The required rooms to complete are all rooms from 2 to 10. The final room which also is the highest number is room 16. Only room 9 can reach this room (using the middle portal). Portals in other rooms will skip room 16 and continue from the start (room 1).

### Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to give players a shortest path from start to end that will pass through any combination of rooms they want.
